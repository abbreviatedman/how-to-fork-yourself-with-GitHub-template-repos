# How To Fork Yourself With Github Template Repos

GitHub has added a nice new feature - the ability to set a repo as a template from which you can create new repos. Basically, it lets you fork your own repo without having to deal with actual git. Let's walk through how to do it!

1. Go to the GitHub page for the repository you want to fork from and go to its Settings page. This has to be a repo you have ownership of--which, for now, is most likely exclusively your own repos.

2. Right below the "Repository name" section is now a "Template repository" checkbox. Check it!

3. Now go to [create a new repo](https://github.com/new) and there's a dropdown at the top for "Repository template". Drop it down like it's a hot clown and you'll find all of the template repos you have access to. Choose the repository you want, give the fork a new name, and away you go!
